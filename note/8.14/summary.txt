This week, i mainly learned Spring security and JWT, and by the way
i finished writing of exception handling 

Due to the daily completion of part of them, i am only summarizing 
the overall structure this time instead of summarizing by day

- Exception Handler
    - make exception-code.properties file as configuration file (ExceptionCodeConfiguration.class)
    - define the exception codes and corresponding exception messages (exception-code.properties)
    - Use the @ControllerAdvice annotation for global unified exception handling
      I created some custom Exceptions with UnifyResponse entity as return which can also be defined customly

- Spring security
    - i tried but something is confusing me, so i deleted the code and excluded it on @SpringBootApplication
    - i will continue to learn in the future by watching some materials from bilibili lessons

- JWT
    - i create a userValidation model to store users' user_name and password
      (this part can be taken place by redis i think, but i stored in mysql currently)
    
    !!! Question: (Is it better to store account passwords in Redis? 
                Or is it better to store them in a separate mysql table? )
        (because i think the data are not security in redis, but i found someone stores 
        the passwords in redis. it makes me confused. )
    
    - InterceptorConfiguration.class implements WebMvcConfigurer interfece
      to add the PermissionInterceptor HandlerInterceptor
    
    - define custom @ScopeLevel(int level) annotation 
        - if user's scope is greater than methods' scope level, he can access the api methods
          else throw new forbidden exception
    
    !!! Question: (Similarly, need users' scope level store in the redis? )
        (I am confused about the using of redis, i think it can improve the data accessing speed
        but not for long keeping, so why does such data need to be stored here? 
        i store these data in ThreadLocal currently)

    - JwtToken.class defined the creation of token and verification
